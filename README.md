Arduino Library
---------------

The Arduino Library is located in the MMA845XQ subdirectory.

To use this library, you will first need the Arduino IDE. Get it at [http://arduino.cc/](http://arduino.cc/).

In order to use the library, you must copy the entire MMA845XQ subdirectory into the libraries subdirectory of your Arduino installation. Be sure to restart the Arduino IDE after doing this.
For details on library installation, have a look [http://www.akafugu.jp/posts/resources/arduino-ide-akafugu/](here).

You should now have a MMA845XQ submenu inside File -> Examples. Open the simple example and press PLAY to compile it.
